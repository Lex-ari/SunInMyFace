# SunInMyFace

## A sleep deprived computer science major's solution to 4 missed alarms and an angry brother.

Background:

I usually set up around 4 alarms to wake myself up and get ready for college or other work. However, me being a sleep deprived college student, I am very likely
to go back to sleep after each and every alarm. My brother hates this as he wakes up from my alarms, and is threatening to make an alarm that blares the
original iphone alarm sound earlier than what I would set my alarm times to. I don't want this, but there aren't many faults with his arguments.

I recently found how people wake up to "sun" alarms where they adjust their brightness 15~30 minutes before their set alarm, giving the body the melatonin it needs
and wake up more naturally. Sounds very appealing, since I usually have to wake up relatively early and my bed does not get an inch of sunlight at all. Hence, the goal of this project is to make "the sun in my face"

Additionally, this project is my own "test" to see if I remember how to code in Kotlin and Android Studio. I haven't touched them since SPHS 2021 and I thought it
would be good practice to re-learn from my past projects.

Current Equipment:

- Google Nexus 7 (has been jailbroken and updated with Android 10)
- Ender 3 Pro 3D printer

**Features:**
- [COMPLETED] Gradual Background "Brightness" increasing
- [COMPLETED] Time Display
- [COMPLETED] Set Alarm Time
- [PLANNED] Saved Alarm Times
- [PLANNED] Color Customization
